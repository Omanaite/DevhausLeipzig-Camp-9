[[JavaScript]] is a programming language that is mainly used for developing interactive web pages. It is a scripting language, which means that it is interpreted and executed by a browser once it is embedded in an HTML page. It is also a client-side language, which means that the code is executed in the user's browser rather than on a server. ^cd9a2f
