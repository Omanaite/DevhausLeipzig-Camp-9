The `nextElementSibling` and `previousElementSibling` are two properties that can be used to [[JS - Navigate between adjacent siblings|navigate between adjacent siblings]] in the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript. ^1ee8aa

To access the `nextElementSibling` and `previousElementSibling` properties, you need to first select the element you want to use as a reference point. You can do this using any of the DOM selection methods, such as `getElementById`, `getElementsByClassName`, `querySelector`, and so on.

Once you have selected the reference element, you can access its adjacent siblings using the `nextElementSibling` and `previousElementSibling` properties.

Here is an example that demonstrates how to use these properties:

```JS
const currentElement = document.getElementById("my-element"); 
const nextElement = currentElement.nextElementSibling; 
const previousElement = currentElement.previousElementSibling;
```

In this example, we first select an element with the ID "my-element" using the `getElementById` method. We then use the `nextElementSibling` and `previousElementSibling` properties to access its adjacent siblings.

Note that these properties return `null` if the adjacent sibling does not exist. Therefore, it's important to check for the existence of the sibling element before attempting to access its properties.
