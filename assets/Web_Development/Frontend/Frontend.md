## CSS Pixels vs Device Pixels

^a6efaa

CSS pixels, also known as "virtual pixels" or "[[CSS - Units]]", are units of measurement used in CSS to define the size of elements on a web page. They were introduced to provide a consistent way of measuring the size of elements across different devices and screen resolutions.

### Understanding CSS Pixels

In CSS, one CSS pixel is equivalent to one pixel on a screen with a resolution of 96 DPI (dots per inch). This means that on a screen with a higher resolution, a CSS pixel will occupy more physical pixels on the screen, making the elements appear smaller. On the other hand, on a lower resolution screen, a CSS pixel will occupy fewer physical pixels, making the elements appear larger.

### Device Pixels

Device pixels, also known as "physical pixels", are the actual pixels on a screen. The number of device pixels on a screen can vary depending on the resolution and size of the screen. For example, a screen with a high resolution may have more device pixels than a screen with a lower resolution.

### How CSS Pixels and Device Pixels Interact

In modern web development, CSS pixels and device pixels interact through a concept called "device pixel ratio". The device pixel ratio is the ratio of device pixels to CSS pixels on a screen. For example, a device with a device pixel ratio of 2 means that one CSS pixel is equivalent to two physical pixels on the screen.

### Conclusion

CSS pixels and device pixels are two important concepts in web development that work together to provide a consistent way of measuring elements on a web page across different devices and screen resolutions. Understanding the relationship between CSS pixels and device pixels is crucial for creating responsive web designs that look good on all devices.
